  ENT Insight - Advanced Medical AI Technology
</h1>

## Project Overview
ENT Insight is an advanced AI-powered medical imaging solution designed specifically for ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) clinical environments. The project aims to enhance diagnostic processes in ENT medicine through the integration of artificial intelligence and deep learning models.

## Problem Statement
Over the past few decades, the healthcare sector has adopted software solutions for managing patient records and medical imaging, significantly improving diagnostic processes. More recently, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical imaging has enhanced the identification of abnormalities, particularly through deep learning (DL) models.

This project addresses the need for specialized AI-powered diagnostic tools in the ENT domain, which handles a wide range of conditions affecting the ear, nose, and throat areas.

## Features
The system includes four sub-modules for detecting and diagnosing:
- Foreign Objects in the throat
- Sinusitis
- Cholesteatoma
- Pharyngitis

## System Architecture
The system has two front-end interfaces:
- Web application built with NextJS
- Mobile application built with Flutter

These interfaces allow doctors and radiologists to:
- Upload medical images
- View diagnostic reports
- Access patient data

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend Architecture**: NodeJS-based REST API with Flask server for deep learning analysis
- **AI Models**: CNN models including ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3, and YOLO
- **Multi-Platform**: Web and mobile interfaces for comprehensive accessibility
